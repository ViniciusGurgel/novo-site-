                <p class="texto-introducao">I'm an university student, studying computer science at UniCEUB. Just finished learning the basics of HTML and CSS and created my fisrt portfolio website.
                    I'm currently studying to become a programmer in Brazil. I love coding and hope to become a professional programmer one day.
                    I started learning to code when I was 18 years old because I wanted to make my own video game.
                    Now, coding has become a daily routine for me and there is so many possibilities one can do with such knowledge. Below are some code I learned or am learning.</p>

                <p class="texto-introducao">Python is a  interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
                    Python enables you to create dynamic and interactive features,
                    handle complex data analysis tasks, automate routine operations, and integrate with external services. 
                    Python can also be used to develop various types of software, including web applications, scientific simulations, 
                    machine learning models, and more. Personally, it is my favorite language to learn. There's a project I made using python,

                <p class="texto-introducao">HTML is the standard markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, 
                    that define the different parts of a webpage. HTML provides a semantic structure to the content, specifying headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
                    CSS, on the other hand, is a styling language used to describe the visual appearance of HTML elements. It allows you to control the layout, 
                    colors, typography, and other design aspects of a webpage. With CSS, you can customize the presentation of HTML elements, making them visually 
                    appealing and consistent across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

                <p class="texto-introducao">C is a low-level language know for its efficiency, speed, and close-to-hardware capabilities. C has had a significant impact on the 
                    field of computer programming and has influenced the development of many other programming languages.To this very day, it is one of the most used languages for
                    programming.C is most commonly used in application development and systems programming.</p>

                <p class="texto-introducao">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language. Java has become one of the most popular programming languages 
                    due to its simplicity, robustness, and wide range of applications.Java is most commonly know as platform independence,java code,bytecode, can be executed
                    in any system compatible with JVM(Java Virtual Machine). I'm currently studying this language so I can become one step closer to becoming a full stack 
                    programmer.</p>
